    Wrote validator for id input in the app.
    App now filters out anything that is not a valid kinase HUGO id.

    Modified app to feed diffusion script actual string IDs.
    Hooked up diffusion script with id coverter.

    App now shows actual diffusion output as table.
    Scores now include z-score, and hide the initial y=1 proteins (labels).
    Move up submit bar to top of screen, so table shows up in middle of screen when you diffuse.
    Added title to tab, added favicon.

    Created SimilarityMatrix container class that holds both the network and the protein ids.
    Inputs now correctly map to the network.
    Formatted Data table (pagination and precision) -- almost good, Dash seems to hide trailing 0s
